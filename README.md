Sticky Notes macOS App

This is a macOS app for sticky notes that stay on top of your windows. It’s minimal, clean, and does exactly what you’d expect – nothing more, nothing less.

How It Works
	•	Open a Note: Hit Command + Option + 0 to bring up a sticky note.
	•	Change Colors: Switch between them
	•	Adjust Font Size: Use the + and - buttons to resize the text.
	•	Always On Top: Your note stays visible, even when switching between windows.

Installation
	1.	Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sticky-notes-app.git
cd sticky-notes-app


2. Open in Xcode, build, and run. Or donwload the app from Releases

That’s It

It’s a sticky note app. Enjoy!
